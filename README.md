How Jack Sawyer punched Ohio State's ticket to the CFP title game in 83 long, glorious yards
ARLINGTON, Texas — It felt like forever.
The run felt like forever. The jaunt. The trot. Call it what you want. A rumble.
It looked like forever, too. All 260 pounds of Jack Sawyer racing — is that the right word? — down the sideline.
In the stands, his family watched.

Run, Jack. Run. Ruuuun.

The 20, the 30, the 40…

“I think I said 70 times in a row, ‘There’s no way! There’s no way! This isn’t real!’” Jack’s sister, Kyla said, “and then I started crying and I don’t remember the rest of the game.”

On Thursday night, the Orange Bowl College Football Playoff semifinal delivered to us one of the worst unforced, game-securing turnovers in college football history (Penn State quarterback Drew Allar’s pick in the final seconds).

On Friday night, the Cotton Bowl semifinal conjured up one of its own, this time a forced turnover by the big, meaty paws of Ohio State’s star defensive end: a swatting sack-fumble and then a rousing, game-ending scoop-and-score of 83 yards.

Run, Jack. Run.

The 50, the 40…

“I felt like I was in quicksand because I was trying to get into the end zone so fast,” Jack said afterward.

He eventually crossed the goal line, striding into that end zone, into the record books, sending the Buckeyes to the national championship game with a 28-14 win over the Texas Longhorns.


In a stunning turn of events, Sawyer’s scoop-and-score ended what turned out to be a dreadful series of plays for the Longhorns.

Texas, down 21-14 with 3 minutes, 56 seconds left, faced a first-and-goal at the 1-yard line. Steve Sarkisian’s team went backward: a run for no gain; an inexplicable toss play for a 7-yard loss; an incomplete pass; and then, on fourth-and-goal from the 8, Longhorns QB Ewers cocked his arm in an aim toward the end zone, a pass that may have tied the game.

He never fired. Sawyer beat right tackle Cameron Williams around the edge, swatted at Ewers’ cocked arm, popped the ball free, cradled it into his arms as it bounced off the turf and began his long, exhausting journey into history.

He took off down the sideline not unlike how a heavily weighted object tumbles from too small of a slingshot.

Run, Jack. Run.

The 30, the 20…

“Eighty-three yards,” his mother said, “is a long way for a big boy!”

As he raced down the Ohio State sideline, players and coaches ran with him. The crowd roared. And, on the field, trailing Sawyer, linebacker Sonny Style made a key block of Texas running back Quintrevion Wisner.

It’s a good thing, too: Wisner would have caught ol' Jack.

“I looked back and hoped I had a blocker because receivers were out there,” he said, “and I don’t have wheels like that.”

Afterward, he leaped into coach Ryan Day’s arm. A long embrace. Tears. Smiles. The emotions of the last several days, months and years on display.

Sawyer was Day’s first ever commitment after he was elevated to head coach. He’s an Ohio kid from the Columbus suburb of Pickerington, a town of about 23,000 where he grew up with a Scarlet and Gray-painted room covered in Buckeyes decals.

He’s a two-year starter, a three-year letterman and was the highest-rated recruit in Ohio State’s 2021 signing class. More recently, you may know him as the guy who prevented Michigan players from planting the flag at midfield of Ohio Stadium.

He wrestled away the ‘Block-M’ flag in a wild on-field fracas that followed Ohio State’s last loss. Perhaps, the Wolverines sparked something in this team. The Buckeyes are playing like we all thought they would — the most talented roster in the sport and the preseason national championship favorites.

They have outscored their three playoff opponents (Tennessee, Oregon and Texas) 111-52. And though the offense stumbled into dry spells on Friday, the defense roared to life. It’s not like we haven’t seen this before.

In fact, that late-game goal line stand was the third such this year. They did it against Penn State, Indiana and Nebraska, too. Known for their explosive offensive players, the Buckeyes are bringing the wood under defensive coordinator Jim Knowles.

They sacked Ewers four times and held the Horns to less than 60 yards rushing. Ewers had 16 incompletions.

It was a nasty effort, led by Sawyer, who, as it turns out, was Ewers’ roommate at Ohio State as a freshman.

In fact, after the game, Ewers playfully barked toward Sawyer, “Screw you!”

In the postgame news conference, Day gestured toward Sawyer, “I love guys who go through difficult times, stay strong, defend who they love and come out the back end. This guy right here.”

Sure, quarterback Will Howard produced some highlights. He threw for 289 yards and ran for some key first downs, including a fourth-down conversion on a touchdown drive. TreVeyon Henderson had his moments, too. How about his 75-yard touchdown on a screen pass in the waning seconds of the first half?

But this was Jack Sawyer’s day.

Afterward, across a confetti-covered AT&T Stadium field, Sawyer toted the massive Cotton Bowl MVP trophy. He signed autographs. He took pictures. He did interviews. He lingered on the field as long as any single player, basking in this.

“I love this state. I love Columbus, Ohio. I love this f***ing … this damn team so much,” Sawyer said. “I’d go to war with these guys over and over again and the man in charge, who means so much to me, my family and the rest of the guys on the team.

“We are playing for a national championship like we’ve always dreamed of here.”

Kyla, his older sister by 2.5 years, backed up her brother: “This is really what his dream was his entire life,” she said through tears. “To see all the hard work paying off, it’s incredible.”

Before he stepped on a raised platform for the trophy presentation, Sawyer gripped the football that he chugged those 83 yards. But he couldn’t accept the MVP trophy with a ball in his hands.

He wheeled around to find long-time Ohio State sports information director and all-around-good-guy Jerry Emig. Sawyer handed the ball to a smiling Emig.

“Don’t give it away!” Sawyer told him.

As Sawyer bounced around to post-game interviews and such, Emig held the ball high to the thousands of Ohio State fans who traveled to a cold and snow-covered Dallas.

“This is the ball!” Emig announced. “This is the ball he scored with!”

He did score, didn’t he? He finally did make it to that end zone. It took forever.

Run, Jack. Run.

The 10, the 5…

As he approached the goal line, Jack shot glances toward the Ohio State sideline. Up in the stands, his dad, Lyle, screamed toward his son: “Quit talking to your teammates and get in the end zone, you big dummy!’”

Run, Jack. Run.

College Football Playoff: Jack Sawyer's fumble return TD cements Ohio State's Cotton Bowl win over Texas
The Buckeyes will meet Notre Dame for the national title on Jan. 20

Ohio State will meet Notre Dame for the national title.

The Buckeyes defense stopped Texas near the goal line with less than three minutes to go as Jack Sawyer’s fumble return with 2:13 remaining gave the Buckeyes a 28-14 win over the Longhorns in Friday night’s Cotton Bowl.

Sawyer stripped Quinn Ewers on fourth down and recovered the ball himself before officially running it 83 yards for the score.

“I saw the ball pop out right to me after I tackled him and I was thinking I just gotta stay on my feet because like I said, I almost blacked out when I saw all that green grass in front of me,” Sawyer said in a postgame interview on ESPN.


Trailing by seven, Texas had first and goal from the Ohio State 1-yard line after back-to-back pass interference penalties in the end zone. Jerrick Gibson got stopped for no gain on a first down run up the middle. That led Texas to pitch it to the outside to Quintrevion Wisner on second down.

That worked out poorly. Ohio State’s defense read the pitch perfectly and stopped Wisner for a 7-yard loss. Ewers’ third-down pass to Ryan Wingo got tipped at the line of scrimmage and then Sawyer came off the edge on fourth down to clinch the game.

Ewers started his college career at Ohio State before transferring to Texas after his first and only season with the Buckeyes. Sawyer was his roommate at Ohio State.

Ohio State took a 21-14 lead with 7:02 to go when Quinshon Judkins scored his second TD of the night. That TD was the 13th play in an 88-yard drive that took nearly eight minutes. It also came after Will Howard converted a key fourth down on a QB run up the middle after Ohio State had put all of its receivers on the right side of the formation to spread the Texas defense out.

Any hope Texas had of mounting a miracle comeback disappeared just after the two-minute warning when Caleb Downs intercepted Ewers with 1:44 to go.

The Buckeyes will take on the Fighting Irish on Jan. 20 in Atlanta after Notre Dame beat Penn State 27-24 in the Orange Bowl on Thursday night. That game served as the other College Football Playoff semifinal. It will be the third meeting in four seasons between the teams and all have come in Marcus Freeman's time as the Irish's head coach. Freeman is a former Ohio State linebacker and his alma mater has won each of the previous two meetings.

Overall, Notre Dame and Ohio State have played six times. The Buckeyes are 6-0 dating back to the first matchup in 1995.

Texas kept Jeremiah Smith quiet
If you would have told Texas fans before the game that Ohio State freshman star wide receiver Jeremiah Smith would have one catch for three yards, they’d have thought Texas would be the team facing Notre Dame for the national title.

The Longhorns did a phenomenal job keeping Smith in check on three targets. Texas’ pass defense has been one of the best in the country, and they blanketed Smith after he had scored four touchdowns over the first two games of the College Football Playoff.

But as Texas had Smith covered, other players stepped up for Ohio State. Carnell Tate, the team’s No. 3 wide receiver, led the Buckeyes with seven grabs for 87 yards. And running back TreVeyon Henderson gave Ohio State the lead before halftime on a 75-yard TD on a screen pass.

Texas tied the game at 7-7 with less than a minute to go before the half. With the Texas defense playing back to prevent a big play, Ohio State ran a screen for Henderson, and he broke through his wall of blockers to head to the end zone.

It was Henderson’s only catch of the game as he rushed six times for 42 yards.

The Longhorns' best offensive weapon was running back Jaydon Blue. And not on the ground. Blue had five catches for 59 yards and caught both of Texas' touchdowns. The Longhorns had the most offensive success stretching Ohio State's defense horizontally near the line of scrimmage. Especially with wide receiver Matthew Golden limited by an ankle injury. Blue and Wisner combined to catch 11 of Ewers' 23 completions.

Ohio State’s uneven performance
The Buckeyes had been the most impressive team in the playoff through the first two rounds and looked destined for another rout in the first quarter after stopping Texas on fourth down on the Longhorns’ opening drive and then capping their own first drive with a Judkins TD.

But Texas hung around for much of the game as Ohio State’s offense wasn’t able to consistently get rolling against one of the best defenses in the country. Ohio State punted four times between touchdowns in the first half as eight consecutive drives ended in punts after Judkins’ first score.

And in the second half, Ohio State opened the third quarter with an interception and punted twice before the 13-play drive to take the lead.

Those mid-game lulls were a big reason why Ohio State had looked less than impressive at times in 2024 despite boasting a roster that could be the best in college football. But that talent is also not a surprise why the Buckeyes will play for the national title despite having two regular-season losses.

Ohio State will play Notre Dame for the national title after beating Texas 28-14 in the Cotton Bowl on Friday night.

The Buckeyes scored 14 straight points in the fourth quarter to seal the game after Texas had tied it in the third quarter. Here are the five plays that defined the game as Ohio State will try to win its first title in a decade.

Jaydon Blue’s first TD catch
Texas was just hanging on for much of the first half against Ohio State. The Longhorns opened the game with the ball and turned it over on downs in Ohio State territory. The Buckeyes responded with a 10-play drive that ended with a TD.

You aren’t alone if you felt like the game could become a blowout early. Instead, it was a slog. The teams combined to punt on eight consecutive drives in the first half before Texas finally got on the board with 29 seconds to go before halftime.

The score came when Jaydon Blue raced out of the backfield and caught a perfect pass from Quinn Ewers for the TD. The 18-yard score tied the game at 7-7 and gave Texas fans a fleeting hope that the game would be tied at halftime after the Longhorns converted all four of their third-down attempts on the drive.
